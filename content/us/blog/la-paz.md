When we first spoke with the owner of La Paz restaurant/bar in Podgorica, it was immediately clear that behind this place stands a serious background of experience and determination. Although La Paz opened in 2021, Marko Tripković has been in the hospitality business for over 15 years - from small cafes, catering services, to managing larger establishments. He brought that knowledge and experience into this new project, with a clear vision: to open a place in the center of Podgorica that would unite good ambiance, quality food, and excellent entertainment.

The location he chose - Njegoševa Street - was a strategic move. Already at opening, La Paz attracted the attention of passersby and lovers of good times. In a short period, it gained status as one of the most popular spots in the city, thanks to the food, ambiance, and events they organize.

But, as in every serious hospitality establishment - beyond good cuisine and atmosphere - a reliable system is necessary that "works in the background" and enables the owner, manager, and employees to have precise insight and control over the entire process. That was the moment when we came in - the KONTY POS team.

## First Contact: How They Heard About KONTY POS and the Transition from Old Software

The owner shared that he had already heard about us through a network of colleagues - other restaurateurs. They mentioned Konty POS as a reliable, simple, and stable system. This sparked his interest, because compared to the software he previously used, he was looking for something that would serve long-term and simply.

When he decided to try it, the transition was quite fast: everything was ready to work in just one day.

One of the deciding factors when choosing was that in Montenegro, Konty POS is distributed by the same team of verified resellers, present for 20+ years in the market. The owner knew he would have free 24/7 support - and from people he can count on.

## How Konty POS Works "Behind the Scenes" - Advantages Marko Highlights

During the conversation, we discussed the specific advantages he felt through working with Konty POS:

### Automatic Adaptation to Fiscal Changes

Over the past few years, there have been several changes in fiscalization laws and regulations. The owner says: he never felt that burden - because everything was pre-adjusted in the software. He didn't have to manually intervene, because entries, formats, forms, report submissions, receipts - were all automatically resolved.

This provides great security.

### Back-Office Accessible from Any Device, Real-Time Insight

One of the best things about working with Konty POS, according to the owner, is the back-office module that's accessible from any device with an internet connection - laptop, tablet, phone. From there he can track:

- inventory and goods
- send orders to suppliers from the office or home
- see at any moment how full the bar is
- track every issued receipt, control errors, statistics, and trends

This gives him complete oversight, without having to be physically present at the location - extremely important for an owner who often has multiple projects.

### Data Security: Cloud Solution as a Lifesaver in Crises

One very striking example the owner shared is that waiters spilled water on the computer (POS terminal). In other systems, this could cause a catastrophe - data loss and work interruption. But in Konty POS software, nothing was lost, because all data is in the cloud, centralized.

Within half an hour, a replacement computer was brought, connected to the system, and they continued working normally - without data loss or major disruptions.

### No Problems with Inspections and Regulations

According to the owner, they've never had problems with inspections, because every module of the software is aligned with the latest regulations - receipt issuing, reports, fiscal records, archives. This provides security: when the inspector comes, everything is "in its place."

## What Would La Paz's Owner Tell Others - Summary of Experience

If we were to go into short quotes or advice that Marko highlighted during the conversation:

- "The transition was quick - a day or two - and the Konty team was with us."
- "24/7 support isn't a myth - they really respond when needed."
- "When they changed laws, I didn't even feel it - because the software adjusted itself."
- "The back office completely relieved my workload - I can run the bar from another address."
- "When the operator spilled water on the computer, I didn't lose anything - thanks to the cloud."

## Conclusion: A Partnership for Long-Term Success

Through our conversation with Marko / La Paz, it's clear that software alone isn't enough - what matters is how it's implemented, what the support is like, what the stability is, how reliable it is in stressful situations. In La Paz's case, Konty POS has proven it can be an invisible partner working in the background, but enabling the bar to shine.

For those considering switching to Konty POS or wanting to improve their existing system, La Paz's story can serve as a concrete example: quick transition, stability, support, security, and real-time control.
