## Wholesale and Retail - One Story About Complete Control

**Fruti Međaš** from Čačak is a company founded in 2014 that deals with beverage wholesale and manages a chain of retail stores.
With 61 employees and total annual revenue of over 622 million dinars, the company under the leadership of Dušanka Trninić has become a recognizable brand in the region.

Before switching to Konty, managing all stores was quite exhausting.
Each store had its own system - some Excel, some old programs, papers, manual records...

"When we needed to tally sales, check warehouse inventory, or send data to accounting - it would take hours.
We'd wait for everyone to send reports, then everything had to be manually entered and checked," they recalled from the company.
Errors were frequent, and the time the team spent on administration took away from the most important thing - focus on business development.

## When Konty Arrived - Everything Changed

They first implemented Konty in two stores to see how it worked.
"After just a few days, it was clear that this was it," they say from the company.

The program is **fast, simple, and clear**, and what they liked most is that it's an **online system** - everything is visible in real-time.
Now, when they open the computer in the morning, they see exactly:

- how much each store sold,
- how much stock is on hand,
- which items are selling best.

They no longer have to call store managers and wait for them to send reports - everything is there, immediately.

## Fast Work and a Warehouse That Finally Makes Sense

At the register everything goes fast - **ringing up receipts, issuing advances, delivery notes, dispatch notes, weight barcodes**, everything works without error.
Konty also has **quick keys**, which makes salespeople's work easier - especially during rush hours.

The warehouse now finally makes sense - they see delivery notes, consumption, sales analysis, and stock status at any moment.
Before, they'd discover shortages only during inventory, but now the program alerts them if something deviates.

## Finance and E-Invoices - Without Paperwork

Previously they sent invoices manually, and now everything goes automatically through **e-invoices**.
Konty also maintains **customer cards**, so they know exactly who paid, who owes, and how their obligations to suppliers stand.
Bank statements are loaded directly into the system - which saves the team and accounting an incredible amount of time.

"What's especially important to us is that Konty has integration with accounting programs, so data is automatically transferred and there's no double entry," emphasizes Fruti Međaš.

## A System That Simply Works - And Support That Always Responds

"Honestly, what we appreciate most is that Konty simply works.
No system crashes, no waiting for it to 'refresh' - everything functions smoothly," they say from the company.

Updates are released imperceptibly, in the background - they don't even notice the program has refreshed, they just see there's a new useful option.

Behind Konty stands a serious team of programmers and support.
"Whenever we needed help - whether it was something technical, or just a question 'where to find something' - technical support was there.
Always available, kind, and patient, even when we call during peak season," emphasizes Fruti Međaš.

## Results - Better Organization, Fewer Errors, and More Time for Business

Since connecting all stores through Konty, they have complete control over operations.
They know exactly which store performs best, where there's a shortage of goods, and where action is needed.

Errors are almost nonexistent, and the team works safer and faster.
Time savings are huge - what they used to do late into the night, they now finish in five minutes.
They can focus on business development, not administration.

"If someone had told us earlier that everything could function this simply, we wouldn't have believed it.
Konty enabled us to connect all sales locations into one system - and to finally have real oversight and peace of mind."

## Conclusion

Konty retail isn't just a cash register - it's a **complete system for managing a retail chain**, with reliable operation, automatic updates, and support that's always there when needed.
