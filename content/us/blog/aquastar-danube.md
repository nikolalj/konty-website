## A Riverside Hotel Combining Comfort and Efficiency

On the banks of the Danube, in the heart of Kladovo, Aquastar Danube Hotel has been attracting visitors for years with its combination of modern comfort and authentic tranquility.
But behind the scenes of that tranquility, the hotel team runs a precisely coordinated operation daily - reception, restaurant, and bar must function in perfect rhythm.

Before implementing the Konty POS system, that rhythm was often interrupted by a familiar problem: how to quickly and accurately connect restaurant bills with guest rooms.
Papers, manual records, calls between departments, and occasional errors - all of this took time and created unnecessary stress.

## The Solution: Konty POS + OTA Sync

Everything changed when Aquastar Danube decided to upgrade their system and connect Konty POS with the OTA Sync hotel system.

Today, when a guest orders lunch, drinks, or dinner at the restaurant, the bill is automatically linked to their room.
No paper, no errors, no hassles at reception.

"Guests order from the restaurant, and everything automatically connects to their room. No paper, no errors, no hassles at reception."

The result?
Faster communication, happier guests, and less stress among employees.

## Flexibility and Constant Support

Konty doesn't just offer a cash register.
It enables working with multiple menus, tracking standards, and quickly issuing invoices and cash receipts - all in compliance with legal regulations.

Aquastar Danube Hotel's management particularly highlights one thing: Konty is constantly evolving.
The development team responds quickly to every request, and new options arrive through regular updates, without any interruption to daily operations.

"We once had an idea for an additional menu option. We sent the suggestion – they added it through an update, we had no disruption to our daily work."

When the law changes - Konty automatically adapts.
When a new need arises - the solution arrives quickly and reliably.

## A Partner, Not Just Software

At Aquastar Danube, they say that Konty isn't just a system, but a partner who understands their business.
The support team is available 24/7 and responds immediately - whether it's a technical question, a legal change, or just advice for a faster way to work.

"If a problem arises - someone from the Konty team is always there. We don't have to wait. That's a huge thing."

## Results

✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Faster and more accurate communication between reception and restaurant<br>
✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Complete automation of connecting bills with rooms<br>
✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with the law without manual updates<br>
✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Happier guests and relieved staff

## Conclusion

Today, Aquastar Danube functions smoothly, without paper, calls, or double checks.
Guests order – the system does everything else.

For this hotel's team, Konty is not just a POS system, but a partner that gives them the confidence to focus on what matters most – their guests.
