Located on Budva's stunning Slovenska beach, Porto Restaurant serves hundreds of guests daily during Montenegro's bustling summer season. But behind the Mediterranean charm and fresh seafood, owner Milan Vučković was fighting a daily battle with technology that threatened to sink his business.

## The Summer That Almost Broke Us

"Imagine this," Milan begins, leaning back in his chair during the off-season. "It's mid-July, every table is full, we have over a hundred beach loungers occupied, and tourists are queuing for tables. Then our POS system freezes. Not slows down – completely freezes."

During the summer of 2023, Porto experienced system failures almost every other day. The old server-based POS couldn't handle the load when all three terraces, the inside dining area, and beach service were operating simultaneously. Waiters would resort to paper notebooks, the kitchen would receive handwritten orders, and payment processing became a nightmare of manual calculations.

"We had one waiter accidentally charge a table for someone else's order – a family meal charged as a corporate event. The complaint went viral on TripAdvisor," Milan recalls with a grimace.

## More Than Just Crashes

The system failures were just one symptom of a larger problem. Porto's legacy POS was designed for a simple restaurant, not a multi-zone beachfront operation with complex needs:

- Beach lounger service required mobile ordering capabilities
- Three separate terraces needed coordinated kitchen routing
- Inventory for the beach bar wasn't connected to the main restaurant
- Tourist customers expected to pay in euros, cards, or even cryptocurrency
- Seasonal staff needed to be trained quickly on a complicated system

"We were losing money in ways we couldn't even track," explains Milan. "How much wine did we pour but never charge for? How many beach orders were forgotten? We had no idea."

## Finding Konty Through a Competitor's Success

The decision to switch came after Milan visited a colleague's restaurant in Kotor. "I watched them handle a wedding party of two hundred guests without breaking a sweat. Their secret? They'd switched to Konty six months earlier."

What impressed Milan most wasn't just the lack of crashes – it was how the entire operation flowed smoothly. Orders from the furthest beach lounger reached the kitchen instantly. Payments processed in seconds. Real-time reports showed exactly what was happening across all service areas.

## A Transformation in Three Days

Konty's team arrived in early May, just before the season kicked off. "I was terrified of changing systems right before our busy period," Milan admits. "But they had a plan for everything."

Day 1: System setup and network optimization for beach coverage
Day 2: Staff training with real scenario practice
Day 3: Soft launch with limited beach service, then full operation by evening

"By the third night, my staff was faster on Konty than they'd ever been on our old system."

## The First Real Test

Memorial Day weekend brought the first major test. Porto was fully booked with over four hundred covers expected throughout the day.

"I kept waiting for something to fail," Milan says. "But it just... worked. Orders flowed, payments processed, reports updated. I actually had time to walk around and talk to guests instead of putting out fires."

The cloud-based system meant that even when one terminal had connection issues on the beach, orders could be taken on any phone or tablet. The kitchen display system automatically prioritized orders based on preparation time and service area. The integrated payment processing handled everything from euros to digital payments seamlessly.

## A Season of Success

By the end of summer 2024, Porto's first full season with Konty, the transformation was undeniable:

### Operational Excellence
- **Zero complete system failures** during the entire summer season
- **Service time cut nearly in half** for beach lounger orders
- **Kitchen efficiency improved dramatically** with better order routing
- **End-of-day reconciliation** reduced from two hours to twenty minutes

### Financial Impact
- **Revenue increased by approximately one-fifth** through better table turnover
- **Reduced losses** from untracked inventory, especially at the beach bar
- **Tips increased** as staff could serve more tables efficiently
- **Lower stress** led to better staff retention through the season

### Guest Satisfaction
- **TripAdvisor ranking** jumped from #12 to #3 among Budva beachfront restaurants
- **Wait time complaints** virtually eliminated from reviews
- **Payment flexibility** praised by international tourists
- **Faster service** consistently mentioned in positive reviews

"The most surprising benefit?" Milan asks. "I could actually sleep at night. No more worrying about tomorrow's crash or lost data. Konty just handles it."

## The Features That Made the Difference

Milan highlights specific Konty features that transformed Porto's operations:

1. **Multi-zone management**: Different menus and pricing for restaurant vs. beach service
2. **Offline resilience**: Continued operation even with spotty beach Wi-Fi
3. **Instant staff onboarding**: New seasonal workers trained in under an hour
4. **Real-time analytics**: Live dashboard showing performance across all areas
5. **Automatic backups**: Never losing a day's data again

## Expanding Success

This winter, Porto is using the quiet season to plan expansion. They're adding a rooftop cocktail bar and expanding beach service. "With our old system, I'd be terrified of adding complexity. With Konty, it's just another zone to configure."

Milan is also leveraging Konty's analytics to optimize for next season. "We now know exactly which beach cocktails sell best at what times, which food items have the highest margins, when to schedule extra staff. It's like having a business consultant built into your POS."

## Advice for Other Restaurant Owners

"Don't wait for a catastrophic failure to make the switch," Milan advises. "Every day you operate with an unreliable POS, you're leaving money on the table and risking your reputation."

He emphasizes that the transition is less disruptive than feared: "We switched during peak season preparation and it was the smoothest operational change we've ever made. The Konty team understands restaurant operations – they're not just IT people."
