We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory. Then, you need to analyze all the translations code in this project related to the SEO implementation, having in mind the following:

1. All SEO features in this project must be implemented using NuxtSEO module and written Nuxt way. You must check my implementation against the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for SEO. Read it, find md files where particular module of Nuxt SEO is referenced and then read those files. After that read all md files from /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/learn/ directory and get module of Nuxt SEO references from there.
2. All SEO features must follow best modern practises for SEO optimization.
3. All SEO features must be implemented using minimal, clean and clear code. No overengineering, no backwards compatibility.
4. Current goal is setting up the structure of the website, not content or images. That will come later.

Please give me a report on what is implemented and how, the good and the bad, what is missing, what can be optimized. The goal of the optimization must be perfectly conversion optimized website.

I want you to analyze and prepare for a discussion. Do not write any code yet. Think hardest.










Lets proceed with: link checker. This is very important part.

You must analyze my implementation for this part of the Nuxt SEO in detail against the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for a this particular part of Nuxt SEO module. Read it, find md files where this part is referenced and then read those files. After that read all md files from /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/learn/ directory and get see if there are any references there.

Remember, we need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Think hardest. Explain what you do and why before proposing any changes.






ok, lets proceed with a plan. remember, we need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Explain what you do and why before proposing any changes







We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory.

The feature we are going to work on is optimizing and organizing translations. In translation JSON files there are a number of translations that are not optimally organized. They are used to translate pages and their sections as well as Nuxt SEO modules.

Translation are used on:

1. Sections of the page that are only present on that one page
2. Sections of the page that are shared, and can be found in different pages
3. Shared components and composables
4. Schema Nuxt SEO module
5. Site config Nuxt SEO module
6. Other places

This means translations can be used only once or multiple times in multiple sections above.

I want you to analyze where translations are used. Then I want you to propose the optimal organization of translations in JSON files. You must make sure that all changes in JSON files are also applied where those translations are used in the codebase. You must not change any translation messages. I need a clean and clear organization that makes most sense. Think hardest. Do not write any code. Present me with a plan for reorganization and optimization.
