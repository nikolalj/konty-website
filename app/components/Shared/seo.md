We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory. Then, you need to analyze the code in this project having in mind the following:

1. All SEO features in this project must be implemented using NuxtSEO module and written Nuxt way. You must check my implementation against the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for a particular section / submodule of Nuxt SEO module (like schema, sitemap, etc.)
2. All SEO features must follow best modern practises for SEO optimization.
3. All SEO features must be implemented using minimal, clean and clear code. No overengineering, no backwards compatibility.
4. Current goal is setting up the structure of the website, not content or images. That will come later.

Please give me a report on what is implemented and how, the good and the bad, what is missing, what can be optimized. The goal of the optimization must be perfectly conversion optimized website.

I want you to analyze and prepare for a discussion. Do not write any code yet. Think hardest.










Lets proceed with: Site Config (Foundation - Do First).

You must check my implementation for this part of the Nuxt SEO in the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for a this particular part of Nuxt SEO module

Remember, we need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Think hardest. Explain what you do and why before proposing any changes.


ok, lets proceed with a plan. remember, we need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Explain what you do and why before proposing any changes
