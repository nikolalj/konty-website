We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory. I want you to dive deeply into the seo related code. I want you to analyze and prepare for a discussion. Think hardest.

You need to analyze the code in this project having in mind the following:

1. All SEO features in this project must be implemented using NuxtSEO module and written Nuxt way. You must check my implementation against the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for a particular section / submodule of Nuxt SEO module (like schema, sitemap, etc.)
2. All SEO features must follow best modern practises for SEO optimization.
3. All SEO features must be implemented using minimal, clean and clear code. No overengineering, no backwards compatibility.
4. Current goal is setting up the structure of the website, not content or images. That will come later.

Please give me a report on what is implemented and how, the good and the bad, what is missing, what can be optimized. The goal of the optimization must be perfectly conversion optimized website.






You should not write any code yet. The goal of the optimization must be perfectly conversion optimized website, implemented using minimal, clean and clear code, written Nuxt 4 way. Think hardest.





now i want to implement it using nuxt's site-config module that is part of the nuxtjs/seo module. I need a clean, best practise implementation. Please create a plan and do not write any code yet. I need a comprehensive plan on site-config implementation that works towards the goal of creating a high conversion website. Before creating a plan read the full docummentation about the site-config module from these urls, and then use that docummentation and that module to create a plan.






ok, lets proceed with a plan. remember, we need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Explain what you do and why before proposing any changes
