We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory. Then, you need to analyze all the translations code in this project related to the SEO implementation, having in mind the following:

1. All SEO features in this project must be implemented using NuxtSEO module and written Nuxt way. You must check my implementation against the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for SEO. Read it, find md files where particular module of Nuxt SEO is referenced and then read those files. After that read all md files from /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/learn/ directory and get module of Nuxt SEO references from there.
2. All SEO features must follow best modern practises for SEO optimization.
3. All SEO features must be implemented using minimal, clean and clear code. No overengineering, no backwards compatibility.
4. Current goal is setting up the structure of the website, not content or images. That will come later.

Please give me a report on what is implemented and how, the good and the bad, what is missing, what can be optimized. The goal of the optimization must be perfectly conversion optimized website.

I want you to analyze and prepare for a discussion. Do not write any code yet. Think hardest.










Lets proceed with: link checker. This is very important part.

You must analyze my implementation for this part of the Nuxt SEO in detail against the Nuxt SEO docummentation and best practises written there. Documentation entry point can be found here /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/llms.md and in it you will see links to all md files that you need for a this particular part of Nuxt SEO module. Read it, find md files where this part is referenced and then read those files. After that read all md files from /Users/nikola/projects/llm/nuxtseo/learn/ directory and get see if there are any references there.

Remember, we need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Think hardest. Explain what you do and why before proposing any changes.

We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory.

The feature we are going to work on is optimizing and organizing translations. In translation JSON files there are a number of translations that are not optimally organized. They are used to translate pages and their sections as well as Nuxt SEO modules.

Translation are used on:

1. Sections of the page that are only present on that one page
2. Sections of the page that are shared, and can be found in different pages
3. Shared components and composables
4. Schema Nuxt SEO module
5. Site config Nuxt SEO module
6. Other places

This means translations can be used only once or multiple times in multiple sections above.

I want you to analyze where translations are used. Then I want you to propose the optimal organization of translations in JSON files. You must make sure that all changes in JSON files are also applied where those translations are used in the codebase. You must not change any translation messages. I need a clean and clear organization that makes most sense. Think hardest. Do not write any code. Present me with a plan for reorganization and optimization.


We are going to continue working on this high converting website. Before we do, I need you to read all files from context directory. Then, you need to analyze all code in this project related to the page organization. Figure out how pages are organized, how they are structured, how they are translated, how is SEO and Schema defined for them, and all related details.

I want you to analyze and prepare for a discussion. Do not write any code yet. Think hardest.






I need you to create placeholder pages:

1. /solutions
   This page will show a list of Konty use cases - applications of Konty to differenty bussiness types. There will be 3 business types for hospitality and 4 business types for retail. Each of these will contain the one paragraph of description with an image related to the business tupe. It will have see more option that will take the user to a separate page for that particular Konty use case.

   Use cases to cover for Hospitality:
    - Restorani (Restaurants): /solutions/restaurants
    - Barovi i kafići (Bars & Cafés): /solutions/bars-cafes
    - Brza hrana / Fast food (Quick Service / Fast Food): /fast-food

  Use cases to cover for Retail:
    - Prodavnice hrane i supermarketi (Grocery & Supermarkets): /grocery-supermarkets
    - Prodavnice odeće (Clothing & Boutiques): /clothing-boutiques
    - Prodavnice mjesovite robe (Convenience Stores): /convenience-stores
    - B2B prodaja i E fakture (b2b): /b2b

  Page stucture:

  ATF – HERO Placeholder
  ClientList.vue
  Statistics.vue
  <list of Konty use cases>
  Pricing.vue
  FAQ
  ContactForm

2. Create a separate page for each use case

  Page stucture:

  ATF – HERO Placeholder
  ClientList.vue
  Statistics.vue
  <section for showcasing Konty for that business type>
  Pricing.vue
  FAQ
  ContactForm

3. Data: For all of these pages there must be single source of truth for data. All if must come from translation files. Data must be structured so that:
 - it follows the current organization of translation files
 - it allows for simple change / edit in the future or addition of new use cases

Make a detailed plan to accomplish this. Think hardest.
How will we implement only the functionality we need right now?
Identify files that need to be changed.

We need minimal, clean code, with no backwards compatibility, written Nuxt 4 way. Go step by step. Take your time. Think hardest. Follow best practices and do not overengineer.

Present me with a plan and propose data structure. Do not write any code yet.







 2 pages that are going to be one under /konty-hospitality and one under /konty-retail and will have a longer description of features for each. /konty-hospitality and /konty-retail are pages about Konty Point of Sale for hospitality and for retail and include different sections. they do have features section with high level feature explanation and when user clicks see more he is to be taken to one of these new two pages with a detailed decription of features.

Next 3 pages that we need to create are pages in about us section in header menu.


Sections:
ATF - headline i subjeadline
Detailed list of all features
